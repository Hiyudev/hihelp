## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was primarily done to study modern mobile technologies and create a real-world application using the [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) technology stack. Not just the tech stack, I used libraries like [React navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for fast and reliable routing, [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) for UI components and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for form validation.

It was only possible to create this application with quality because of the incredible event called Ignite Lab, an online bootcamp made by a great company called Rocketseat.
And this event was conducted by¬†[Rodrigo Gon√ßalves](https://github.com/rodrigorgtic), a educator at Rocketseat.

3. Run the project locally on an emulator ( Its not possible to run on physical device because Expo + Firebase does not support Expo Go mobile application )
